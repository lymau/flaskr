https://www.linkedin.com/in/ervandioirzky/,,"When I was a kid, my parents used to read me a story from a children's book. I love the art of storytelling and now I do the same. But, instead of telling a story from a children's book, I do storytelling with data (not for kids, obviously). As a data analyst, I gather insight by crunching a bunch of words and numbers, share the data through visualization, and communicate my analysis results and recommendations to the stakeholders using the art of storytelling. In my opinion, extracting and processing the data using various tools is an important skill that every data analyst should master, but data analysis is more than that. A good data analyst should have really good business acumen and deductive reasoning skills to make useful and effective recommendations out of data and communicate them to the stakeholders. So, for me, the thing that makes a data analyst stand out from the others is remarkable communication, storytelling, and prescriptive analytic skills. After all, data analyst is a data-driven decision-maker, right? Albert Einstein once said: ""Once you stop learning, you start dyingâ€. Data analytics is a never-ending learning process, there will be a better and better method and solution. As a data analyst, I am proficient in using programming languages such as Python and MySQL to extract and delve into the data to identify the problems that need to be solved and business metrics related to it, doing structured analysis using both exploratory and statistical methods, presenting it using data visualization software like Tableau or Excel, and communicate my analysis and recommendation to the stakeholders through a presentation. Does it stop right there? No. I will always be in the continuous learning process to develop myself and sharpen my skills. I can't promise you that I will be the best data analyst in the world.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/misael-natanael-b406531ab/,,"I'm a person who really love to teach other, sharing knowledge and experience, mentoring, and other stuff with aim to make others understand. Since I was in high school, teaching my friends in study group (math and science subjects) has been my interest. Throughout my college years, I had been a lab and teaching assistant in total 13 subjects. I also have been working in 5 formal and informal tutoring centers as tutor in math and physics subjects. Well, those are my experience about teaching. But I'm not stopping yet. Along with my partner, I created education-based YouTube channel, TPB Santuy, with purpose to help undergraduate students to understand Elementary Physics and Basic Calculus. Working on this YouTube project channel really brings another challenge to myself. From this project, I've learned about very basic video editing, efficient and effective presentation, and some simulation tools. Aside from that, I've also become interested in computer programming language. I took several classes about computation throughout college years. Many of the projects from the class are really interesting such as simulating motion of a particle under certain circumstance, analyzing frequency spectra from musical notes, and simulating bottleneck traffic in highway road. Most of the projects were done using MATLAB computing tools. I also did my thesis project (which talks about light scattering from nano sized particles) using MATLAB. Nevertheless, computing never cease in just one programming language/tools. I began to learn another programming language such as Python and R as I became interested in data analytics and machine learning topics. My first project in Python was very challenging. I had to implement Monte Carlo â€“ Markov Chain method to obtain some parameters from an astronomical model. I managed to handle that project after 1-2 months experimenting. The next following projects I took were about machine learning and data mining techniques such as decision tree, regression, basic neural network etc. During the quarantine time, I have decided to intensively learn data analytics and machine learning using Python, R, and SQL. Iâ€™ve learned about data cleaning, data visualization, supervised and unsupervised learning, hyperparameters tuning, and pipeline.

Database understanding is a must, and now I am using MySQL for the DBMS. Apart from technical skill, knowing the business process is also important. Although I'm not a very quick learner in this part, once the knowledge is getting into my brain, it will be there (for almost) forever. Talking about creating regular report, I like to make an automation reporting system using Google Script Apps. In Trusting Social, most of my reports are created in Google Spreadsheets. Combining with Script, I could make from an automatic email notifications to prepare data for reporting. Now I am doing self learning about anything that could excel my analytic skills, e.g. Python and Pentaho Data Integration. For Pentaho, I also use it for one of my monthly report.

Fluent in imperative programming languages. Loves to master & experiment with software technologies. Geeks out in computer science. Has a special interest in high-performance computing field. I live as an INTJ-T person, have a strong IT background, and highly concentrated in software engineering discipline. I have been coding since I was 12 or exactly at around 7th grade of middle school, then I started to discover more and more interesting technologies from various fields. I actually started to focus on more productive web development when I was at 11th grade of high school (before that, I was focusing on GUI & systems programming and computer graphics & game development as a hobby with C/C++ and C# as my primary languages). Now web development and distributed systems are my primary focuses. Microsoft's COM/RPC architecture introduced me to the cool realm of distributed systems. See https://michaelrk02.github.io/ for my complete skillset. I learn quickly through my passion and intuition, have decent problem-solving and debugging skills, always break down complex systems into smaller and reusable components, always ensure software security & stability through defensive/offensive programming techniques, have a fundamental understanding of concurrency, code according to standards & best practices, and prefer automating repeated processes. I am also flexible and open for new challenges and learning new things in CS-related field (e.g. artificial intelligence, robotics, embedded systems) in order to fit company needs. But in the other hand, I have weak CSS styling skill & UI/UX sense (due to my preference for quality & performance over visual styles), and incomprehensive cybersecurity knowledge. But I'm open to do security research when security assessment is needed. However, I always care about security standards such as password-hashing, digital signatures, SQL-injection and XSS attack prevention.","Full-Stack Development, Back-End Web Development, Distributed Systems, Engineering, Software Development, Systems Analysis, Programming, Web Applications, Object Oriented Design, Multithreading, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Cloud Computing, Front-end Development, System Administration, Computer Networking, Game Development, Computer Graphics, Algorithms, Data Structures, Computer Science, C (Programming Language), C++, C#, Java, PHP, SQL, JavaScript, Python (Programming Language), Operating Systems, Linux, Windows, Git, Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, Technical Leadership, Intellectually Curious, Self Learning, Intuitiveness, Logical Approach, Go (Programming Language), Lua, Systems Programming, Interoperability, Graphical User Interface (GUI)",Full-Stack Development,1,Back-End Web Development,0,Distributed Systems,0,Engineering,0,Software Development,0,Systems Analysis,0,,"Surakarta, Central Java, Indonesia","Studying computer science with theoretical & practical approach.

College was the first place where I learned the very basic of coding. Starting from Java, PHP, MySQL, a little bit of prolog and many more. Thankfully coding were much more easier to learn than physics, maybe because it's practical (?). And through my studies, I found that mobile programming is fun especially now that we have Flutter. I enjoy both front-end and back-end, in fact I did both during my internship, though I must say that back-end is more challenging but again each has their own appeals. Still, there will always be more to learn and for all the things that has happened to me, I am very grateful.","Java, MySQL, Android Development, Software Development, Software Testing, Software Quality Assurance, Front-end Development, PHP, Android, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Flutter, Python (Programming Language), Visual Studio, Multitasking, English, Android Studio, Dart",Java,1,MySQL,1,Android Development,0,Software Development,0,Software Testing,0,Software Quality Assurance,0,"Working in a team as a Flutter Developer.

Provide easy to use and safe schema migration tools for service databases with very little disruption to services. This project was created to increase the number of users of rg-postman. To increase the number of users, that is by making it easier to use rg-postman itself. One way is to add a collection example sync feature. Where when the owner of the service adds a collection example then all subscribers will get the same collection example. - Service Stitcher (rg-stitcher) Many services function as stitching services, so a service stitcher is made. Service stitcher using Graphql, one of the reasons for using Graphql is that clients can only request the data they need (not all of the data they receive) so that the required bandwidth is small. - rg-string-repo, include figma. Improvement. Added a new endpoint in the rg-string-repo for insert bulk key string with translation (CMS). This is made because one of the difficulties experienced by users is when inputting several key strings with the same platform and tag repeatedly. Added new fields for response errors and error translate messages into the language of the country where the service is deployed.","Yogyakarta, Indonesia",,Associateâ€™s Degree,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/pt--tokopedia/,https://www.linkedin.com/school/13035/?legacySchoolId=13035,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
